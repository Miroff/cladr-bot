Description: dbfpy is a python-only module for reading and writing DBF-files.
        It was created by Jeff Kunce and then modified by Hans Fiby
        and Yaroslav Samchuk.
        
        dbfpy can read and write simple DBF-files.  The `DBF-format
        <http://www.clicketyclick.dk/databases/xbase/format/>`_
        was developed about 30 years ago and was used by a number
        of simple database applications (dBase, Foxpro, Clipper, ...).
        The basic datatypes numbers, short text, and dates are available.
        Many different extensions have been used; dbfpy can read and write
        only simple DBF-files.
