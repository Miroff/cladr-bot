DESCRIPTION = """\
dbfpy is a python-only module for reading and writing DBF-files.
It was created by Jeff Kunce and then modified by Hans Fiby
and Yaroslav Samchuk.

dbfpy can read and write simple DBF-files.  The `DBF-format
<http://www.clicketyclick.dk/databases/xbase/format/>`_
was developed about 30 years ago and was used by a number
of simple database applications (dBase, Foxpro, Clipper, ...).
The basic datatypes numbers, short text, and dates are available.
Many different extensions have been used; dbfpy can read and write
only simple DBF-files.
