I have used this code, in various forms, to read .dbf files.
It includes some experimental code to write to .dbf files.
This code may provide a starting point for others.

Files:
    dbf.py      reads (and possibly writes) .dbf file data directly from disk
    dbfload.py  reads an entire .dbf file into memory, provides access to data
    binnum.py   a module to decode/encode binary numbers
    strutil.py  a module of string utilities
    dbfnew.py   a module to create new .dbf files
    county.dbf  a sample .dbf file
    readme.txt  this file
    dbfpy.tgz   the distribution tarball

dbf.py and dbfload.py are independent ways to access .dbf files.
